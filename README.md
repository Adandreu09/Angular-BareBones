# Angular 2 and TypeScript Bare Bones Project

This is an Angular 2 starter project that has the npm modules, scripts, folders, 
and routing in place to make getting started with an Angular 2 project easy!

Here's what is in the project:

* Angular 2 bootstrapper
* App component
* Homepage component
* A single "feature" component (represents a custom feature your app would have)
* A simple data service
* Routing between the homepage and the "feature"
* Bootstrap for CSS

The rest is up to you!

If you're using VS Code, install my [Angular 2 code snippets](http://codewithdan.com/2016/03/19/angular-2-typescript-and-html-snippets-for-vs-code) 
to simplify the process of writing Angular 2 code. The code snippets make it easy
to build Angular 2 components, services, pipes, directives and more.
